- try 512 hidden nodes in model layers.
- what are our minibatch sizes, try 32 as DQN paper?
- check epsilon greedy, annealead linearly from 1.0 to 0.1
- check replay memory amout, try larger?
- try RMSProp optimizer, as DQN paper?
- systematic grid search of all hyperparameters?
- check discount rate, use .99?
- memory buffer,  A more sophisticated sampling strategy
might emphasize transitions from whic. see https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.05952.pdf for prioritized experience replay.
